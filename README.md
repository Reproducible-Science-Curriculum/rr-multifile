##Purpose
To teach students to VERB [and VERB] the way that organization can be used to inform themselves and others about the project throughout its life

##Motivation
Why is it worth organizing?
Graph Illustrating effort verse time. Yes, this is a little painful, but think of how painful it will be during publication process.

##Overview of exercises
- get a bunch of files (raw data, scripts, overall .Rmd): run the whole thing to produce clean data and output files
- now have a bunch of files (raw and clean data, scripts, results); how to organize them?
    - README file explaining everything
    - organize into subfolders (separating code from data)
    
- Potentially re-run .Rmd: have them actively reorganize and change paths
- Get a version with files reorganized; add some new analysis to the main Rmd file
- Lecture interlude: 
      - If you gave to friend how do those path names affect that?
      - what we had to change (paths) to redirect files
      - importance of absolute vs relative paths
      - what if you were to move this to a new computer?
      - Working directory
      
- metadata exercise: what metadata will you want to record in order to explain what files are what, and which ones produce which others
      - for yourself, coming back to this 6 months from now
      - for a collaborator
      
- versions: how do they keep track of versions of things? (discussion in small groups and then come back together)

      - periodic zipping of project directory
      - Time Machine or other backup system
      - project on dropbox
      - github
      
- (Lecture interlude: demonstration of GitHub)
