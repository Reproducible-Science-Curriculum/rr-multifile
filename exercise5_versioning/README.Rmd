##Exercise 5 Versioning

Group together and discuss systems that could be used to capture versions of
the state of your project.  Here are some questions to ponder:

* When you added the Norway analysis to the project.Rmd script:
  * what files were overwritten in the process?
  * what if you broke one of the underlying code files?  Would you be able
  to get it back?
  * what if you wanted to go back and look at the overall result produced
  with just the Sweden data? Could you do that easily?
* Is it easy for you to add a new analysis to this project, or do you worry
  that you are going to 'break' the existing one?
* How much storage does your solution require?
* In order for you to 'roll back' to a previous state:
  * Does your system require you to have something other than your computer with
  you?
  * Does your system require you to fiddle the paths in the project.Rmd or code?
