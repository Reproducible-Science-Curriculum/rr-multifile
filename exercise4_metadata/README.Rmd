##Exercise 4

You will work together in groups to discuss ways to keep track of Metadata not
included into the directory structure of the project.  Here are some questions
to keep in mind while doing so:

* If you gave your directory to a friend, would they be able to use it?
* If they downloaded it from the internet, would they be able to tell
that all files downloaded properly?
* Would they be able to identify the specific input files used to produce
each specific results file?
* Would they know how to cite you?
* Would they be able to tell which data are changed/deleted during the cleaning
step, and why?
